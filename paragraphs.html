    <h1 style="color:crimson">introduction of django</h1>
   <p style=color:darkorchid"><b>django</b> Django is a<i>sharmila</i> high-level web framework written in Python that allows developers to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications quickly.

It was created in 2003 and made open source in <i>2005</i> by the Django Software Foundation (DSF).</p>

Django follows the ModeTemplateView (MTV) architecture pattern, which is similar to the ModelViewController (MVC) pattern used in many frameworks. The Model defines the structure of the database and handles data through Python objects instead of SQL queries. The Template controls how data is presented to the user through HTML pages, and the View handles the business logic that connects the models and templates. This separation of concerns makes Django applications more organized and easier to maintain.
